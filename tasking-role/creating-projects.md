# Creating Projects

Not only do you need to know the basics of how the Tasking Manager works to create projects, but also the why and how to address projects that might not fit the TM and some best practices.

### LearnOSM: Tasking Manager

Before creating tasks, make sure you are familiar with how the user interacts with the Tasking Manager by working through [Tasking Manager User Guide](https://learnosm.org/en/coordination/tm-user/). Then continue on to the next section [Tasking Manager Administrator Guide](https://learnosm.org/en/coordination/tm-admin/)

## OSM Tasking Manager

### Before You Build

Before creating the project in the Tasking Manager, make sure the priorities for both the area of interest and the [COD/FOD](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/glossary/) makes sense; work with the Data and Imagery roles to determine what imagery should be used and the appropriate tagging scheme.

In some cases the Tasking Manager is not a good tool for coordination, if the project is sensitive, maps features that are long and continuous like borders or waterways, or sometimes if the area of interest is small there may be too many mappers and the potential for conflict, etc. makes the objective not fit; other tools like Mapswipe or MapRoulette microtasking platforms or just a few mappers using the JOSM GeoChat plug-in might be a better fit.

### Project Creation \(Steps 1 - 3\)

Step 1 of project creation on the tasking manager, you select the area of interest/set the bounding of the project. There are two ways to do this:

* Drawing by hand
* Import a file \(such as an admin boundary\)

Step 2 is to choose either square or arbitrary geometry for the tasks (from your loaded file in step 1).

Step 3 is to select the tile size, this is where experience helps as we typically want the tasks to be completed in no more than 30 minutes, but if the task is more difficult or tedious maybe 5-10 minutes is better. A good rule of thumb is 1 square kilometer for rural road projects, down to .1 square kilometer (or less) for urban buildings.

### Project Settings

Once the task is created, it is by default only a draft. There are many settings and field that need to be complete before the task is published: 

* Description Tab: Fill out the name, short and long descriptions as well as set the priority and status here.
* Instructions: Set the entities \(map features\) for the project, changeset comment and provide instructions here \(more on instructions later\).
* Metadata: Set the level, types of mapping, any iD preset restrictions, organization, campaign, category and optionally OSMCha filters
* Priority Areas: Additionally you have 'high-priority' areas in the project, set them here.
* Imagery: Add imagery links here and set any license agreement required.
* Permissions: allow any user to map and validate, or restrict by mapper level or allow only teams, additionally allow a team to manage the project.
* Actions: this is where you may mark (all) tasks as complete, or start over, message everyone, transfer ownership, clone or delete the project.
* Custom Editor: this is where you enter the URL for a custom editor that can be opened by the user from the task selection area of the project.

### Making Clear Instructions

Make sure the instructions are clear and easy to understand, many volunteer mappers may not read English well, so the more simple and clear the language the less work the Validation Activator\(s\) will probably have.
