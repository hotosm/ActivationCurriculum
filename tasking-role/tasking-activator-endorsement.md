# Tasking: Activator Endorsement

After you have completed the course exam you will be added to the roster as a Tasking Trainee. Review these assignments for specific requirements, some items can be completed outside of an Activation but at least one requirement will need to be completed while performing the role during an Activation.

## Part 1: Project Manager Request

Visit [http://tasks-stage.hotosm.org](http://tasks-stage.hotosm.org) and log-in with your OpenStreetMap account, it is not required to do any mapping, just to log-in and give permission for the development instance of the OSM Tasking Manager to access your OSM profile.

Once you've done so, visit [https://groups.google.com/a/hotosm.org/forum/?hl=en\#!forum/tm-project-managers](https://groups.google.com/a/hotosm.org/forum/?hl=en#!forum/tm-project-managers) and apply for membership; in the additional information box briefly introducing yourself, mention that you are taking the course and a little about why you are interested in performing this role and why you think it is important to a successful Activation.

Return here and give a brief note that the procedures are complete, remember to include your OSM Username!

You will receive a reply that you have been added to the Project Manager mailing list \(group\) and you will be scheduled for a training session. Due to the limited number of trainers and the volume of training requests we get, this could take several weeks to schedule.

## Part 2: Draft Project

You will be trained as if you were going to be an administrator of a new organization. Where possible, we may schedule your training with other Tasking Activators or Organization Admins. After completing the training, create a draft project on the development instance (tasks-stage.hotosm.org) of the OSM Tasking Manager, make sure to include thorough instructions and other appropriate settings.

Once you are satisfied, insert a link to the project and a brief description of the desired outcomes into the text submission box for this assignment.

An experienced Tasking Role Activator will review your draft project, provide feedback and once satisfied will grant your OSM account permission(s) on the main instance of the OSM Tasking Manager here: [http://tasks.hotosm.org/](http://tasks.hotosm.org/) - this may be as an admin of a HOT managed organization, or as part of a team that can be used to manage existing projects. Make sure you've visited and logged into tasks.hotosm.org in order for your username to appear in the database.

## Part 3: Disaster Mapping Project

The final step to gain endorsement for the Tasking Role is during an Activation or simulation, coordinate with Activation Lead\(s\), Data, Imagery and Validation roles to maintain priorities and/or create project\(s\); provide a brief description of the activities performed and the names of the Activators you collaborated with in the text box for this assignment. Hint: the best way to accomplish this is to stay tuned to the disaster-mapping channel in Slack or the Activation Working Group email and volunteer whenever there is an opportunity.
