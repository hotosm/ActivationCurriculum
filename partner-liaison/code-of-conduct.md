## Representing HOT

### Code of Conduct

Review the [HOT Membership Code](https://github.com/hotosm/hotosm-website/blob/gh-pages/downloads/HOT-Membership-Code.pdf), which includes a Code of Conduct. Here we will discuss details specifically relevant to Partner Liaisons. Sections I and III are broadly relevant to liaisons, however Section II has several clauses to note:

* Section II, clause 2. - an effective liaison will understand their counterpart's mission and principles and communicate to the HOT community how and why our missions align for an effective partnership.
* Section II, clause 4. - this clause is written almost directly to liaisons, as well as the community if/when they are talking to partners; in general, liaisons should know and comply with HOT policy and guidance or ask an HOT Director for clarification when dealing with partners.

### HOT Mission and Principles

In order to determine if an existing or potential partnership is a good fit, liaisons need to first know and understand HOT's mission and principles.

The HOT mission statement is:  
The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team \[HOT\] applies the principles of open source and open data sharing for humanitarian response and economic development.

And the community has drafted principles, but at the time of creating this course, they had not yet been officially adopted. The draft principles, as well as discussion, can be found here: [https://hackpad.com/Mission-Statement-and-Principles-pOyhfqngvdQ](https://hackpad.com/Mission-Statement-and-Principles-pOyhfqngvdQ)

In general, the HOT principles are adapted from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian\_principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_principles) to include some more language about open source and digital working environments.

### Duty During Activation

During an Activation, those trained as Partner Liaison will be expected to monitor communication for potential partnership opportunities. Often non-profits, as well as first responder or government agents of the local community will discover HOT during an event and may try to reach out through the main mailing list or be introduced through a common collaboration channel such as a Skype room set-up for coordinating the response, through the Digital Humanitarian Network or various social media channels. It is the duty of the Partner Liaisons to make sure those communications are addressed and that contacts are recorded for further communications.

Partner Liaisons may have to use multiple communications channels to effectively meet the partners where they are. Examples include: slack, telegram, whatsapp, signal, IRC, skype.

### Review

When Partner missions are not in conflict with the HOT mission or principles, Liaisons should strive to fulfill both missions?

* True
* False
