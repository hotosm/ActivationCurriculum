## Maintaining Relations

#### Existing Partners

Of course those interested in becoming liaisons should know who our current partners are. However, for privacy protection the list of contacts is securely maintained by HOT Operations Staff. After endorsement Partner Liaisons will have access to the document upon approval of Operations or the Executive Director. Other information on existing partnerships is available to the public and all documentation you have permission to view will be in the HOT Drive: <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1EorbpNCZ03flhOQTZKdlU4NHI0TlBzb1RjZHB1UzA4TmJ0NkZfNDR1SUdUVUVMT05JVTg">Partner/Project Folder</a> (save the link).

#### Partner Projects
One way HOT maintains lasting partnerships is by engaging in collaborative projects. These are showcased on the website which also allows for co-branded messaging through updates. Liaisons involved in these projects ensure that the project page and updates are published and maintained. Visit the Partnership Page to explore these partner projects.
