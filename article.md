**Imagery Availability**

During the size-up of an event and decision to respond, the Imagery Activators will need to quickly assess imagery availability in the area of interest.

**Sources of Imagery**

For OpenStreetMap editing, there are many sources of immediately available imagery; leading up to an Activation the Imagery Activator(s) will need to quickly assess the quality of imagery available to get mappers started right away and/or to work with liaison(s) to request imagery in the area of interest. There is a [wiki-page with a list of imagery commonly available for OSM editing](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Aerial_imagery).

**OpenAerialMap**

HOT maintains a tool for discovering and sharing openly licensed aerial imagery called OpenAerialMap
