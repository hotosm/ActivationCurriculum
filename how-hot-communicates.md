Published by our partner, the Digital Humanitarian Network, the "[Volunteer and Tech Communities](http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/guidance-collaborating-volunteer-technical-communities)" guide is an excellent resource to start thinking about effective communication strategies.

### Basic Communication

This unit will cover the basics of HOT communication, the tools and methods for mostly internal (global HOT community) communications.

#### Mailing Lists
HOT has many mailing-lists; there is a master spreadsheet with over 50
that HOT owns or co-operates/moderates that will be shared with endorsed
Public Relations Activators. For training purposes these are the most
important:

The ['main' channels posted on the wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team#Communication):
* hot@openstreetmap.org - the [main HOT mailing-list](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/hot) for all community/public discussion
* info@hotosm.org - for general communication with HOT the organization (HOT's Core Operations Team - 24/7 monitoring)

Most Working Groups also have an email account:
* Activation Working Group: activation@hotosm.org
* Communications Working Group: communications@hotosm.org
* Other [Working Groups](http://hotosm.org/working-groups)' information can be found on the website

#### Text Chat

HOT uses the <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/IRC">IRC real-time chat platform</a> hosted by OpenStreetMap Foundation. There are many ways to access the platform, there is a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients">comparison of clients</a> for every operated system. HOT is at irc://irc.oftc.net/hot or irc://irc.oftc.net #hot depending on your client.

#### Voice Chat

HOT hosts <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mumble">Mumble</a> for live voice chat, unlike IRC there are no in-browser options, a client must be installed. However, it works well in low-bandwith compared to Google Hangouts or Skype (although we use those as well sometimes). 

Public Relations don't need to be on these live channels often, but should be able to when needed; find a client for IRC and one for Mumble that works well for you.

#### Colaborative Documents

For collaboration on press releases, blog/update posts, and other messaging Public Relations should be familiar with a few tools and resources. HOT maintains a google drive, called the <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1EorbpNCZ03fml2OURJZ21mU2I4Qm9aQlRSbHpFNHNfVkdnZGlJU3ZFcjBsZEZab2hGOWc">HOT Drive</a>. Most 'official' HOT documents are drafted using the google applications (docs, sheets, etc.). Some of the working groups and some other documents are drafted on <a target="_blank" href="https://hackpad.com/">Hackpad</a>. The common theme for drafting almost any sort of document for HOT purposes is that it is done in a collaborative environment, the only exception is for sensitive communication which should be handled by the Activation Lead, Partner Liaison or appropriate HOT Leadership.<br><p><br></p>

#### Review

Match the communication channel/method with the following usages. Choose among the following: Google Docs, HOT mailing list, Mumble, communications@hotosm.org
* Email communication with the entire HOT community.
* Email communication with the Communications Working Group.
* Live voice chat, typically used for meetings.
* Collaborative document platform used for drafting messaging and press releases.



### Advanced Comms

Now we'll look at 'how' these tools are used, but first a few more tools to know about.

#### Activation Coordination 
The Activation Lead(s) will typically be the ones who will set up the tools and methods for coordinating among the Activation Team. Due to it being generally related to communications the Public Relations volunteers may be delegated to set-up and/or help maintain team collaboration. Here are a few tools you should become familiar with:

* [Google Sites](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDEQFjABahUKEwiArs_WgrnHAhVLCZIKHX2EBUU&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsites%2Foverview.html&amp;ei=cH7WVYC2LcuSyAT9iJaoBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGfTgBCldbppBHTVoHwZx1YYe1TtQ) - typically only used for keeping track of lots of external information.
* [Trello](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAAahUKEwjmjK7egrnHAhXIfpIKHckTCpw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftrello.com%2F&amp;ei=gH7WVebMO8j9yQTJp6jgCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGERS4yYpddS2mm7XYgB1ozgT4xMQ) - typically used for Activation Team tasking and tracking.

#### External Communications

The Activation Team, mostly lead by the Reporting role will also maintain either or both a wiki-page and website project page. You will want to familiarize and possibly take the Reporting course to learn about creating and editing:<br><ul><li>Activation wiki-pages, built from this <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Template:Activation">wiki-template</a></li><li>Activation project pages, explore the <a target="_blank" href="http://hotosm.org/projects/disaster-mapping">existed ones on the website</a>

#### Training Resources

More thoroughly discussed in the Validation role course, Public Relations will also be answering questions from individuals who may need basic help understanding OpenStreetMap. Be familiar and ready to point to these resources:

* Of course <a target="_blank" href="http://learnosm.org">LearnOSM</a> is the most referenced resource for all types of learning materials.
* Know how to navigate and search the wiki for local guidelines like <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa">Highway Tag Africa</a>.
* The <a target="_blank" href="http://hotosm.github.io/tracing-guides/">OSM tracing guides</a> for specific tracing tactics like buildings, roads, etc.

#### Review

Public Relations volunteers do not have an active role in Activation coordination.
* True
* False
