# Using OSM Data

There are so many ways to use OSM data and we can't cover them all here; this unit will focus on common usage of geo-data for disaster/humanitarian response.

## Items to Read

### LearnOSM: Setting up PostgreSQL

Some requests for assistance might include how to use the data inside a database, before we get into using OSM data, [this LearnOSM module](https://learnosm.org/en/osm-data/postgresql/) shows some basics about databases using QGIS and PostgreSQL.

### LearnOSM: Using OSM Data in QGIS

Now that you know how to get the data, this [LearnOSM section, Using OSM Data in QGIS](http://learnosm.org/en/osm-data/osm-in-qgis/) will briefly explain how to use it. This is not a complete training on spatial analysis or geographic information systems, but teaches the basics so the Usability role can assist people who may not be familiar with OSM but who might be geodata users in another capacity.

### LearnOSM: Manipulating Data with Osmosis

Now let's look at how you might handle manipulating large amounts of OSM data. Please read the [Osmosis section of LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/osm-data/osmosis/)

## Spatial Analysis

Although stated before, this course isn't for becoming a GIS or spatial analysis expert; but HOT does expect a basic level of understanding how the experts use geodata for disaster.

### How it Gets Used

Our partners tell us they are using OpenStreetMap for all their geodata needs, from basic navigation to estimating the amount of rubble that will need to be removed in the recovery from an event. [A short but good article](http://mediashift.org/idealab/2012/09/crisis-mapping-with-openstreetmap-a-big-focus-at-tokyo-conference250/) by friend of HOT, Alex Barth, showcases a talk about OpenStreetMap's utility before, during and after disaster.

### HOT and InaSAFE

HOT was selected to help train and promote the [InaSAFE plug-in for QGIS](http://inasafe.org/home/index.html). Since 2011 our team in Indonesia has been heavily involved in growing the OSM community there to collect exposure data that is then used to perform hazard and risk analysis.

You can follow [the InaSAFE team](https://www.hotosm.org/where-we-work/indonesia/) and [the project](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/dam-safety-and-public-protection-through-inasafe) on the HOT website.

HOT highly encourages all of it's volunteers, especially those in the Usability role to explore the [training materials](http://inasafe.org/for-users/index.html) and become familiar with using InaSAFE.

### Review

Activators in the Usability role are required to have university or professional training in spatial analysis.
