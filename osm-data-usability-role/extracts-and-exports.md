# Extracts and Exports

This module teaches how to extract features or export whole areas from the OSM database.

## Items to Read

### LearnOSM: OSM Data Overview

This [LearnOSM module is a good introduction to the OSM data model](http://learnosm.org/en/osm-data/) and the entire Using OSM Data section of LearnOSM will be covered in this course.

### LearnOSM: File Formats

Of course to use the data you need to understand the file format native to OSM as well as other common geodata formats. Please read the [File Formats section of LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/osm-data/file-formats/).

### LearnOSM: Getting the Data

Next step to learn is how to extract data from OpenStreetMap. Please read the [Getting OSM Data section of LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/osm-data/getting-data/)

### Study the Tools

During an Activation the Usability Activators may be under pressure from Activation Leads and/or Partner Liaisons to assist first responders or aid organizations extract data quickly, which may take setting up services or communicating with developers and/or maintainers of extraction and export services; knowing these tools ahead of time is key, make sure you know these tools well:

* [The HOT Export Tool](http://export.hotosm.org/)
* [Geofabrik Website](http://download.geofabrik.de/)
* [Overpass-turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/)
* [OSMaxx Extract Tool](https://osmaxx.hsr.ch/)

### Let it be Known

Even during Activations of smaller scope, but especially moderate and major events, the Usability Activator\(s\) should try to get ahead of the game by working with the Reporting and Public Relations Activator\(s\) to document that HOT is generating data and instructions of where and how to get it. Typically these can be one or more of the following:

* On the Activation Wiki-page, view the [section in the West Africa Ebola wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2014_West_Africa_Ebola_Response#Exporting_OpenStreetMap_data) as example, and explore others.
* On the [Humanitarian Data eXchange](https://data.humdata.org/), with a special token on your Export Tool log-in, you can send exports straight to HDX.
* Through other messaging such as website blog/updates, email, social media, etc. - work with Public Relations.

### Review

The Usability role should only extract or export upon request from the Activation Leads in order to reduce the load on the OpenStreetMap server.

* True
* False
