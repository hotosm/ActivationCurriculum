## Imagery Availability

During the size-up of an event and decision to respond, the Imagery Activators will need to quickly assess imagery availability in the area of interest.

## Sources of Imagery

For OpenStreetMap editing, there are many sources of immediately available imagery; leading up to an Activation the Imagery Activator\(s\) will need to quickly assess the quality of imagery available to get mappers started right away and/or to work with liaison\(s\) to request imagery in the area of interest. There is a [wiki-page with a list of imagery commonly available for OSM editing](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Aerial_imagery).

## OpenAerialMap

HOT maintains a tool for discovering and sharing openly licensed aerial imagery called [OpenAerialMap](http://openaerialmap.org/). To learn about the history or follow the development of the tool, visit [the project page on the HOT website](http://hotosm.org/projects/openaerialmap).
