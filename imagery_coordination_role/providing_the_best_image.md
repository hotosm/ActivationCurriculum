# Providing the Best Image

This unit will explain the process\(es\) that HOT uses when imagery is lacking in the AOI, how to request imagery as well as how to host and use imagery once provided.

## Requesting Imagery

So how does HOT get imagery if it's not already available from the usual sources?

### HOT Imagery Coordination Group

HOT has a group of core imagery experts and partner liaisons that have built a great collaboration with a variety of imagery providers. As an Imagery Activator, you might not be invited to discussions until you have built up some trust with the imagery coordination group, however you may be assisting with identifying the bounds of the area of interest and need to know the basics of the request process.

### Request Process

At the time this lesson was built, HOT was still drafting a more robust Imagery Request process, currently there is a short [process outlined in the Activation wiki-page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/HOT_activation#Imagery_Coordination).

### Review

All official HOT imagery requests need to come from the Imagery Coordination Group.

* True
* False

## Providing Imagery

Most new mappers are not going to know how to get new imagery and often imagery providers are not sure how to make their imagery available for tracing, this lesson will teach how to get new imagery to the mappers.

### Adding Imagery in JOSM

To understand the 'full' process of getting an outside source of imagery, including having to agree to sign an agreement with the provider, there is a good google document for [adding OrbView Imagery into JOSM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MB8h-5oyvygEHl213OzkMWN-HpV83b4bb0xzzDXffO4/edit).

### Adding Imagery via Tasking Manager

To make it as simple as possible for the new mapper, you can add 'remote control' linkage directly into the project on the Tasking Manager. Work with the Tasking Activator\(s\) to set-up the project, only certain end-point/RESTful services work, so alternatives may need to be explored.

### Adding Imagery to QGIS

Imagery Activators may also be asked to assist first responder or partner organizations to utilize imagery outside of OSM editing. The process should be very similar to getting imagery into JOSM, but HOT is working to make it even simpler to do by developing a [plug-in for importing imagery from OpenAerialMap into QGIS](https://github.com/hotosm/oam-qgis-plugin); potentially this tool could be developed further to allow importing of imagery outside of OAM.

### Review

Match the appropriate tool with the following objectives, OAM Plugin QGIS, OpenAerialMap, OSM Tasking Manager.

* A non-profit drone club has imagery they are willing to license openly, but need help with hosting and sharing.
* A partner organization has imagery hosted as TMS, but wants mappers to agree to not use it for any other purpose.
* First responders have sensitive data that they want to overlay on top of new drone imagery recently added to OpenAerialMap.
