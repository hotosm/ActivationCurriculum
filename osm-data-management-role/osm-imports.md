# OSM Imports

## Items to Read

### OpenStreetMap Copyright

Before ever attempting a data import, have a thorough understanding of [the OpenStreetMap copyright and licensing](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright).

## Importing Data

Importing can never be a rushed process, often the Data Activator\(s\) need to explain the restrictions even when it is a life saving potential.

### License!

The single most important factor to whether or not a dataset should be imported is the license, there are several immediate flags that may mean no:

* Share Alike - some share alike licenses may be compatible for tracing or even direct import to OSM, but should be carefully inspected and may require specific permissions.
* Non-commercial - this is an absolute no, unless the original author grants explicit permission.
* Any proprietary license that would normally be illegal to copy.

Even with very restrictive license, if the original author/creator of the data is willing to grant explicit permission, it can be imported into OpenStreetMap; There are a vareity of templates on the [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Getting_permission) that may fulfill that explicit permission granting.

### Import Process

There are several steps to the import process once the license has been verified as compatible or permission is granted to import, the full explanation is on the [Import page of the OSM Wiki:](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import)

### Review

The first and most important step of an import is to verify the _what?_ complies with the ODbL?
