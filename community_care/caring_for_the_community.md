# Caring for the Community

This unit will teach how to recognize situations or individuals putting themselves, the organization or others at risk and need moderation or guidance.

## Items to Read

If there is one thing you read about the legal responsibilities and risks of contributing as a digital volunteer, this article published by the Wilson Center should be it.

This publication of the Wilson Center, by Edward S. Robson, Esq. reads quick and provides a ton of information regarding the legal risks and protections for digital humanitarians: [https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/responding\_to\_liability\_1.pdf](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/responding_to_liability_1.pdf)

## Legal Risks

The previous unit looked at individual health risks, but there are other risks to community including legal action against the organization or individuals.

### HOT Volunteer Coverage

So are you or any other HOT volunteers at risk of litigation if something is done wrong during an Activation? Unfortunately the answer is yes, there is no absolute protection from someone trying to sue you or anyone else as an individual. However, there is little risk to those who are acting reasonably and under the direction of the Activation Protocol as HOT is a registered non-profit corporation and would be the responsible party in the United States. However, outside jurisdictions could allow an individual to sue another individual even if they can prove they were 'doing as they were told'.

### Minimize Personal Risk

Here are the basics that every individual can do to minimize their own liability:

* Operate within the Activation Protocol and HOT Code of Conduct at all times.
* Actively participate in amending, or at minimum inform your Activation Lead, when policy or guidance is not working with practice.
* Immediately inform the HOT Executive Director of any legal concerns.

### Review

Although you did your best to follow the HOT policy and guidance during an Activation, litigation can be brought against you.

* True
* False

## Conflict Resolution

Unfortunately we are sometimes a risk to each other even in good mental and physical health; simple disagreements can lead to some of the same trauma as dealing with disaster if not dealt with quickly and completely.

### When to Intervene

Debate is a part of the Open Source type community that HOT belongs to. Healthy debate is good, but digital communication can easily be misunderstood and even a well meaning constructive criticism can begin an argument that can damage the entire community. Keeping in mind the signs and dealing individually with people showing signs of disaster stress, the Community Care Activators need to monitor the HOT communication channels and try to intervene before a conflict occurs.

### Resolution Process

The HOT Community Working Group has drafted a Resolution Process. Outline:

* Key Messages
* Steps to Normalize/De-escalate
* Actions
* Supporting Items/Questions

If these methods fail, email the Activation Lead with Executive Director copied and inform them of the situation and measures taken in attempt to resolve.

### Review

Choose the appropriate action to the following situation \(there may be more than one correct answer\): Two volunteers are arguing on the main mailing list over which project should take priority, neither of them are on the Activation Team and the Tasking Activator informs you that they set the priority after discussion with the Activation Lead.

* Email the individuals explaining that the Activation Team sets the priority and the can discuss the matter directly with you if they would like, but not to argue on the main list.
* Email the main mailing list explaining that the priorities have been set by the Activation Team and there should be no further discussion on this list on the topic.
* Email the Tasking Activator with the Activation Lead copied explaining both sides of the argument.
