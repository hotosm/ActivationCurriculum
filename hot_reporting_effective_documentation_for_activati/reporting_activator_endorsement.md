# Reporting: Activator Endorsement

After you have completed the course exam you will be added to the roster as a Reporting Trainee. Review these assignments for specific requirements, some items can be completed outside of an Activation but at least one requirement will need to be completed while performing the role during an Activation.

## Introduction

In an email to your mentor, briefly tell us why you are interested in performing this role and why you think it is important to a successful Activation?

## Wiki Editing

## Activation Review

Document an Activation or Exercise Simulation \(After Action\) Review: provide the Activation or Simulation name and the Activator Mentor who gave guidance/endorsement during this activity in an email to your mentor.
